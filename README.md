# Bubble Comparator

A browser based bubble chart generator, designed to visualise and compare elements within a set of numerical values.
Demo accessible here [here](http://afiore.github.com/bubble-comparator).

## Requirements

The Bubble Comparator is based on [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3): Mike Bostock's excellent data visualisation library.
It requires a modern browser supporting EcmaScript 5 and capable of rendering SVG.

## Credits

The bubble chart generator was started as part of the [Energy and Climate Hackday](http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/London-GB/609192/), held in London on the 3rd of March 2012.
Idea by Rufus Pollock, implementation by Andrea Fiore.
