# Bubble Comparator

A browser based bubble chart generator, designed to visualise and compare elements within a set of numerical values.
A working demo is accessible [here](http://afiore.github.com/bubble-comparator).

## Requirements

The Bubble Comparator is based on [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3): Mike Bostock's excellent data visualisation library.
It requires a modern browser supporting EcmaScript 5 and capable of rendering SVG.
